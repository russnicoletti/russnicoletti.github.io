initSidebarItems({"enum":[["Pragma","The `Pragma` header defined by HTTP/1.0.The \"Pragma\" header field allows backwards compatibility with HTTP/1.0 caches, so that clients can specify a \"no-cache\" request that they will understand (as Cache-Control was not defined until HTTP/1.1).  When the Cache-Control header field is also present and understood in a request, Pragma is ignored. In HTTP/1.0, Pragma was defined as an extensible field for implementation-specified directives for recipients.  This specification deprecates such extensions to improve interoperability.Spec: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234#section-5.4Examples"]]});
