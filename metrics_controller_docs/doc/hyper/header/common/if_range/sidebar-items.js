initSidebarItems({"enum":[["IfRange","`If-Range` header, defined in RFC7233If a client has a partial copy of a representation and wishes to have an up-to-date copy of the entire representation, it could use the Range header field with a conditional GET (using either or both of If-Unmodified-Since and If-Match.)  However, if the precondition fails because the representation has been modified, the client would then have to make a second request to obtain the entire current representation.The `If-Range` header field allows a client to \"short-circuit\" the second request.  Informally, its meaning is as follows: if the representation is unchanged, send me the part(s) that I am requesting in Range; otherwise, send me the entire representation.ABNFExample values`Sat, 29 Oct 1994 19:43:31 GMT` `\"xyzzy\"` Examples"]]});
