It supports two entry point styles which enables different kinds of deserialization.1) The `visit` method. File formats like JSON embed the type of it's construct in it's file    format. This allows the `Deserializer` to deserialize into a generic type like    `json::Value`, which can represent all JSON types.2) The `visit_*` methods. File formats like bincode do not embed in it's format how to decode    it's values. It relies instead on the `Deserialize` type to hint to the `Deserializer` with    the `visit_*` methods how it should parse the next value. One downside though to only    supporting the `visit_*` types is that it does not allow for deserializing into a generic    `json::Value`-esque type."],["EnumVisitor","`EnumVisitor` is a visitor that is created by the `Deserialize` and passed to the `Deserializer` in order to deserialize enums."],["Error","`Error` is a trait that allows a `Deserialize` to generically create a `Deserializer` error."],["MapVisitor","`MapVisitor` visits each item in a sequence.This is a trait that a `Deserializer` passes to a `Visitor` implementation."],["SeqVisitor","`SeqVisitor` visits each item in a sequence.This is a trait that a `Deserializer` passes to a `Visitor` implementation, which deserializes each item in a sequence."],["VariantVisitor","`VariantVisitor` is a visitor that is created by the `Deserializer` and passed to the `Deserialize` in order to deserialize a specific enum variant."],["Visitor","This trait represents a visitor that walks through a deserializer."]]});
