A regex program can never contain both.It would be worth investigating splitting this into two distinct types and then figuring out how to make the matching engines polymorphic over those types without sacrificing performance.Other than the benefit of moving invariants into the type system, another benefit is the decreased size. If we remove the `Char` and `Ranges` instructions from the `Inst` enum, then its size shrinks from 40 bytes to 24 bytes. (This is because of the removal of a `Vec` in the `Ranges` variant.) Given that byte based machines are typically much bigger than their Unicode analogues (because they can decode UTF-8 directly), this ends up being a pretty significant savings."]],"struct":[["InstRanges","Representation of the Ranges instruction."],["Program","Program is a sequence of instructions and various facts about thos instructions."]]});
