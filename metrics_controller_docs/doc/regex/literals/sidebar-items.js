Currently, there are three implemented:The prefix is a single byte. Just use memchr. If the prefix is a set of two or more single byte prefixes, then a single sparse map is created. Checking if there is a match is a lookup in this map for each byte in the search text. In all other cases, build an Aho-Corasick automaton. It's possible that there's room here for other substring algorithms, such as Boyer-Moore for single-set prefixes greater than 1, or Rabin-Karp for small sets of same-length prefixes."]]});
