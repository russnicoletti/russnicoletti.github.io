Additionally, this client can be cloned and all clones can issue (concurrently) requests to the server, using the same underlying HTTP/2 connection.Example"],["SimpleClient","A struct implementing a simple HTTP/2 client.This client works as an HTTP/1.1 client with a Keep-Alive connection and pipelining might work.Multiple requests can be queued up (and sent to the server) by calling `request` multiple times, before any `get_response`.Once a `get_response` is issued, the client blocks until it receives the response for the particular request that was referenced in the `get_response` call.Therefore, by doing `request` -> `get_response` we can use the HTTP/2 connection as a `Keep-Alive` HTTP/1.1 connection and a pipelined flow by queuing up a sequence of requests and then \"joining\" over them by calling `get_response` for each of them.The responses that are returned by the client are very raw representations of the response.ExamplesIssue a simple GET request using the helper `get` method. Premade connection passed to the client.Issue a simple GET request using the helper `get` method. Pass a connector to establish a new connection."]]});
