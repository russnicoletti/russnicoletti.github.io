initSidebarItems({"struct":[["Lit","A single member of a set of literals extracted from a regular expression.This type has `Deref` and `DerefMut` impls to `Vec<u8>` so that all slice and `Vec` operations are available."],["Literals","A set of literal byte strings extracted from a regular expression.Every member of the set is a `Lit`, which is represented by a `Vec<u8>`. (Notably, it may contain invalid UTF-8.) Every member is said to be either *complete* or *cut*. A complete literal means that it extends until the beginning (or end) of the regular expression. In some circumstances, this can be used to indicate a match in the regular expression.Note that a key aspect of literal extraction is knowing when to stop. It is not feasible to blindly extract all literals from a regular expression, even if there are finitely many. For example, the regular expression `[0-9]{10}` has `10^10` distinct literals. For this reason, literal extraction is bounded to some low number by default using heuristics, but the limits can be tweaked."]]});
