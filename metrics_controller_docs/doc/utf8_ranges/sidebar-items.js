That is, no two sequences will match the same bytes.ExampleThis shows how to match an arbitrary byte sequence against a range of scalar values.If this example seems circuitous, that's because it is! It's meant to be illustrative. In practice, you could just try to decode your byte sequence and compare it with the scalar value range directly. However, this is not always possible (for example, in a byte based automaton)."]]});
